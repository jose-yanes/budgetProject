# BUDGET PROJECT

<h1> Budget Project</h1>

<p>Personal project in order to track my expenses and practice coding :)</p>
<p>Node, express, mongo and Chart.js</p>

<p> The idea is to have a web app where I can save my expenses anywhere and have a real-time tracker</p>

<p>I will temporarely suspend this project while I keep learning node</p>
<p>The idea is to return in the future with new knowledge and add features or re-write this application to make it better</p>
